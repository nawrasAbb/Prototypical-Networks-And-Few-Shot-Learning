Mahalanobis distance:
	is too hard to calculate on vectors of length 1600
	adding FC layers after CNN reduces the dimention, but network stops learning
	
Euclidian distance:
	adding FC layers after CNN, then network stops learning
	
Tweaks:
	learning rate 0.002 performs better than 0.001
	alpha parameter slightly improves accuracy (?)
	14-way performs better than 10-way  
	16-way performs better than 14-way
	128 filters better than 64 filters
	
	
ResNet:
	used ProtoNetResidual based on resnet18 from "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition" https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385
	it learns faster then regular CNN ProtoNetSimple, but each iteration takes more time due to slightly increased number of parameters
	total accuracy is not so good (60% vs 65+%)
	
	used ProtoNetRes12 based on resnet12 got approx 63% with less number of filters from paper (TBD)
	
	
ResNetSimple: (dense CNN)
Overfits heavily
