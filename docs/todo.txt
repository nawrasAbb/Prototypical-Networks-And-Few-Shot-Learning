[v] understand / run the code from paper (omniglot)
[v] try to understand creation / loading of episodes
[v] add weight decay in half after each 20 epochs (use StepLR Scheduler, step_size=20, gamma=0.5)
[v] implement validation loop
[v] implement model saving
[v] add early stopping with patience 100
[v] add test flow
[v] refactor loss function
[v] run training with 14 ways with alpha
[v] add resudually connected network
[v] add Mahalanobis distance
[v] add temperatured distance
[v] add seed to eval
[v] add dropout to ResNet
[v] add dropout to ProtoNetSimple
[ ] add training from existing model
[v] add plots - create script - accuracies per epoch / losses per epoch
